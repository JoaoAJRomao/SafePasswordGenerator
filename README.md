This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## About this project

This project is part of a personal study on software development. In this project, I have to:

1. Generate a password
2. Allow user to use capital letters
3. Allow user to use lower case letters
4. Allow user to use symbols
5. Allow user to use numbers and
6. Allow the user to define a character range (12 to 27)

Was fun to try this, because never used Next.js before.

Current using client side because was how I learned to use React and...  don't know how to use server side yet.

Planing to use the server side in another project and learning more.
